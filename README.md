# Stock-Market-Comparison

For understanding and visualizing the data deeply in fields of data science and real life applications for ex. Understanding stock market values. Charts best interprets to understand and visualize this type of data. Python has an extensive and comprehensive collection of freely available packages covering a variety of topics. Scientific Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Pandas provide efficient implementation in making charts. In this project, we have created types of charts using libraries Matplotlib, Plotly and also given options to user for reading files from which charts are being made by libraries like NumPy and Pandas. The topic is quarterly share values of 3 companies Tesla, Apple, and Skechers. To understand share values like high’s, low’s and compare their share values we have created line chart, bar chart, scatter chart, pie chart, histogram, and candlestick chart. Also we have wrote code to read Csv files from which values is imported, sorting the values as user wants, reading specific columns and Reading Top to Bottom records from file as per user requirement. Also candle stick chart is added so that user can get same experience as they real trading chart. Pie chart shows that out of annual share price what percent was gained on which quarter (3 months period).
